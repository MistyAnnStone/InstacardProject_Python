# InstacartProject_Python

## Objective
Instacart (hypothetically) is interested in creating a targeted marketing strategy. This analysis informs this strategy to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles witht he appropriate products. 

Initial Key Questions:
* What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day?
* Are there particular times of day when people spend the most money?
* How can Instacart simplify their price range groupings to direct their marketing efforts?
* Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? Which departments have the highest frequency of product orders?
* How do different customer types' order behaviors differ?
  * What is the distribution among users regarding brand loyalty?
  * Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's brand loyalty? Their region? Their age or family status?
  * What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?
  

## Data
These data are open-source data sets from Instagart. NOTE that the customer data set is created for the purposes of this project. 

The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017, Accessed from www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017 via Kaggle. 

## Tools
I have used Python and Jupyter notebooks via the Anaconda Navigator to complete this project. I used the following libraries: Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, and Word were also used for this analysis and presentation.
